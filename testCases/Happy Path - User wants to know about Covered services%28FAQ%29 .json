Some types of care may not be a covered service and therefore the plan doesn’t reimburse anything regardless of whether it's in network or out of network.\n\nFor example: A covered service does not mean free, it means your benefits including your deductible and/or co-pay apply when seeking that service. Different plans may choose to cover different services such as fertility.\n\nI can further help you and answer your questions about your benefits plan, healthcare claims and assist you to find a doctor." ]
